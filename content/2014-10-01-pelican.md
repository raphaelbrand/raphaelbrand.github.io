[Pelican](https://getpelican.com) is a static site generator written in python. You write your content in a markup language of your choice, in my case [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and the generator will transform it into static html sites. The html can than be uploaded to a hoster of your choosing. [Github](https://github.com) offers the possibility to host user and projects pages. You can read about the difference [here](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages). In this tutorial i will assume that you host your blog as a user page.

First of all  you will need to create a github repository with the following naming scheme: *username.github.io* (replace *username* with your github username). Then you can clone your repository with:

    :::bash
    git clone git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git

Next up we will generate a new virtual environment and install pelican. I will use a new branch for this, since i want to keep the source and actual blog separate. If you are not familiar with virtualenv or why you should use is it, you should read [this](http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/).

    :::bash
    cd username.github.io
    git branch source
    git checkout source
    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install pelican markdown ghp-import

Pelican comes with a script to bootstrap your blog. Run *pelican-quickstart* and fill out the details. Make sure to generate a makefile, as it will be used later on. After you ran the command you can view and change your settings in pelicanconf.py. You can view my settings if you checkout the branch source of my blog repository. I also added the following to my .gitignore:

    :::bash
    env
    output
    *.pid
    cache

Now you can write your first post! Create a new file in the content folder and start typing:

    :::bash
    vim content/fist-post.md
    Title: My first post!
    Category: foo
    Tags: foo bar

    This is my first post

Run 

    :::bash
    make html
    make serve

and point your browser to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). If everything looks good we can now deploy the blog to github. First push the source branch:

    :::bash
    git checkout source
    git add .
    git commit -m "first post"
    git push origin source

Then deploy to github with

    :::bash
    make github

#### Themes
Since i did not like the default theme, i chose another one. You can view a list of themes in the pelican-themes [repository](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes). To install a theme just copy the theme folder to a location of your choice and edit the pelicanconfy.py

    :::bash
    THEME = 'path/to/your/theme'

#### Future work
You can heavily customize your blog. This is just a very simple solution to get you up and running. For example you can include comments with disqus or track your site with google analytics. For further reading i recommend the pelican [documentation](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.4.0/).
